The Graphical User Interface is built for CANSAT 2022 Team KALPANA NSUT, New Delhi. 
It is used to monitor and control the satellite's operations. It allows the user to visualize the data received from the satellite and issue commands to control the satellite's behavior.

The GUI helps team to view real-time telemetry data such as altitude, temperature, and battery level, and to send commands to the satellite such as changing its operating mode and adjusting its trajectory.
